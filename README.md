# Area Regge Calculus on a Centrally Subdivided Hypercubic Lattice

In this project we perform the triangulation of a 4d Euclidean spacetime using a centrally sudivided hypercubic lattice . We, then, utilize these results to study the dynamics that the Area Regge action implies in this case.

The repository includes the Mathematica notebook used for the calculations.
